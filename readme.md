## "Epic Journey" | Thinkful Node Capstone
Epic Journey app helps users to keep track of the places they visit by adding location, a description or journal entry, and photos or videos of their trip.   Each trip can be broken down into smaller trips, for instance, going to Greece can be broken into Athens, Mikonos, Delphi, etc., with each smaller trip having its own location, journal entry, and photos.
